# Predicting-Solar-radiation-Level-from-NASA-data-with-Machine-Learning-Regression-Model-

## Brief Summary on the project:

These dataset contain 32686 meteorological datapoint from the HI-SEAS weather station from four months (September through December 2016) between Mission IV and Mission V. 
The data set has 6 columns, as given below:
1.	Solar radiation: watts per meter^2
2.	Temperature: degrees Fahrenheit
3.	Barometric pressure: Hg
4.	Wind direction: degrees
5.	Wind speed: miles per hour
6.	Sunrise/sunset: Hawaii time

## Objective: - 
To predict the Solar radiation levels given the measurements temperature, barometric pressure, wind direction & wind speed.
